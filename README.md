Art-Net (DMX over UDP/IP) adapter for Project Lighthouse.

Using this adapter, the Project Lighthouse display can be controlled like a standard DMX fixture from lighting controllers such as [QLC+](https://www.qlcplus.org/).

<!-- TODO: Add notes on RGB matrix, e.g. linking the QLC+ tutorial, and on size due to requiring multiple universes -->
